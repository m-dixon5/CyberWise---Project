### Colour Scheme
- For the colour scheme I used a limited amount of colours with the majority of the website being a black background and white text. A vibrant blue was used alongside this to highlight certain elements and features such as buttons, menu items and content sections. 

- The page was designed to be simple and to focus on the content hence the colours chosen.
