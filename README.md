### Colour Scheme
- For the colour scheme I used a limited amount of colours with the majority of the website being a black background and white text. A vibrant blue was used alongside this to highlight certain elements and features such as buttons, menu items and content sections. 

- The page was designed to be simple and to focus on the content hence the colours chosen.

## Bugs

- Issue with the whole html content being smaller than the page, meaning there is a gap between the content and right-hand side of the screen. This only applies to screen sizes smaller than desktop. It does not effect any functionality.

- Footer and newsletter sign-up section are centered differenty to rest of the content when not viewing on full-screen desktop.
